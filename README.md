* v1 was my initial jot down of code before I realized there was a lot more depth to be had. Keeping it for posterity. *


v2 supports mod names and filters as follows:
- [Mod] or [Mod Name] followed by the name of the mod you'd like to have in the filter on the next line
- Single spaces between whatever filters and the entries (this is my first solo project outside of school so forgive me)
    -- Will address this later
    
* Tested with Annunaki Genesis and Futurism
